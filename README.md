 The code is a function that takes in an integer n and returns the value of M. The function starts by declaring two variables, ans and M. It then declares a for loop that iterates over all the values from 0 to n-1.
 
 Inside this loop, it swaps v[j] with v[j - 1].
 
 Then inside this loop, it calculates the value of j + 1 using modulo operator % on each iteration until i is reached.
 
 Inside this loop, it calculates the value of ans using addition operator + on each iteration until i is reached.
 
 Finally, it divides ans by M before returning its result as an int type variable which will be assigned to cout's output stream so that you can see what your program prints out at the end of execution
 
 The code is a program that takes an integer input from the user and solves it for the remainder of the input.
